# DuckTasks
All your tasks, in one space - no more duck-ups!

## About the Task

This project involves developing a full-stack web application for task management. The application will consist of a frontend for user interaction, a backend to handle data processing and storage, and a database to persist task information. Below are the detailed requirements for each component:

### Frontend (Web) Requirements
- **Create a Web Page with a Form to Add New Tasks:** Users should be able to input task descriptions via a form.
- **Display a List of Tasks:** Initially, the task list will be empty, but it will update dynamically as tasks are added.
- **Task Completion Checkbox:** Each task in the list should have a checkbox allowing users to mark it as completed.
- **Frontend Framework:** You may use any frontend framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js to build the web page.

### Backend (Server) Requirements
- **Backend Server Setup:** Implement the backend server using any technology like Node.js, Python, or Java.
- **RESTful APIs:**
  - **Add a New Task (POST request):** An endpoint to add new tasks.
  - **Get All Tasks (GET request):** An endpoint to retrieve all tasks.
  - **Mark a Task as Completed (PUT request):** An endpoint to update the completion status of a task.
  - **Delete a Task (DELETE request):** An endpoint to remove a task from the list.

### Database Requirements
- **Database Choice:** Select a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
- **Task Storage:** Create a table or collection to store tasks, with fields for ID, description, and completion status.

### Git Workflow
- **Git Repository:** Initialize a Git repository for the project.
- **Regular Commits:** Commit and push code changes regularly as features are developed.
- **Meaningful Commit Messages:** Write descriptive commit messages like “Added task creation API” or “Implemented task listing”.

### Comments and Documentation
- **Code Comments:** Thoroughly comment your code to explain the purpose of each function or block and describe any complex logic or algorithms.
- **README File:** Provide a README file with setup instructions for other developers.

### Bonus (Optional)
- **User Authentication:** Implement signup/login functionality.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform such as Heroku, Netlify, or AWS.
